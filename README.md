# hello-world
# 👋 I'm Joshua Lum

🎯 **Product Manager | Builder | Storyteller**  
I’m passionate about building digital products that make life better — from helping seniors stay connected to helping people memorize and reflect on meaningful words.

🌱 Currently exploring how **AI and no-code tools** can help builders move faster — using **Cursor**, **Lovable**, and **FlutterFlow**.

### 🧭 What I’m Building

#### 🧓 [MemoryLane](https://memorylane.app) – Stories that connect generations  
An AI companion that helps Singaporean seniors capture and share their life stories, stay engaged daily, and build community.  
→ Built with empathy, habit loops, and AI storytelling.

#### 📖 Bibliolingo – Memorize verses like Duolingo  
A fun, gamified app that helps people memorize Bible verses through spaced repetition and play.  
→ Experimenting with gamification, streaks, and bite-sized learning.

#### 💭 Ponder – Space for thoughtful reflection  
Exploring a digital garden for thinkers — a calm space to slow down, capture insights, and share reflections.  
→ Built as a "vibe coding" experiment with AI + no-code tools.
